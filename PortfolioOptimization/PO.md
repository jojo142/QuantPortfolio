## 1. Define Investment Objectives: 
Determine your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon. Consider factors such as desired return, acceptable level of risk, and any specific constraints or preferences.

## 2. Gather Historical Data: 
Collect historical data for the assets under consideration, including their historical returns over a relevant time period. You may also gather data on risk measures such as volatility (standard deviation), beta, and correlations between assets.

## 3. Calculate Risk and Return Metrics: 
Calculate key risk and return metrics for each asset, such as expected return, standard deviation, and covariance matrix. These metrics help quantify the risk and return characteristics of each asset and their relationships with each other.

### a. Return Metrics:
#### Simple Return: 
Calculate the percentage change in the asset's price or value over a specific period. Simple Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value
#### Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR): 
Calculate the annualized return over a multi-year period, taking into account compounding effects. CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1
#### Total Return: 
Measure the overall return of an investment, considering both price appreciation and income (e.g., dividends or interest). Total Return = (Ending Value - Beginning Value + Income) / Beginning Value

### b. Risk Metrics:
#### Standard Deviation: 
Measure the dispersion of returns around the mean, providing a measure of historical volatility. Standard Deviation = sqrt(sum((Return - Mean Return)^2) / (Number of Observations - 1))
#### Beta: 
Measure the sensitivity of an asset's returns to the overall market returns. A beta of 1 indicates the asset moves in line with the market, while a beta greater than 1 indicates higher volatility. Beta = Covariance(Assset Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)
#### Sharpe Ratio: 
Assess the risk-adjusted return by considering the excess return earned relative to the risk-free rate per unit of risk (standard deviation). Sharpe Ratio = (Asset Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Asset Standard Deviation
#### Sortino Ratio: 
Similar to the Sharpe ratio, but focuses on the downside risk by considering only the standard deviation of negative returns. Sortino Ratio = (Asset Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Asset Downside Standard Deviation

### c. Correlation and Covariance:
Correlation: Measure the statistical relationship between the returns of two assets. A correlation of +1 indicates a perfect positive relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative relationship, and 0 indicates no relationship. Correlation = Covariance(Assset 1 Returns, Asset 2 Returns) / (Asset 1 Standard Deviation * Asset 2 Standard Deviation)
Covariance: Measure the degree to which two variables (returns of assets) move together. Covariance = sum((Asset 1 Return - Mean Asset 1 Return) * (Asset 2 Return - Mean Asset 2 Return)) / (Number of Observations - 1)
