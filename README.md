## Breaking into the Quant world:  
Building a quantitative portfolio to showcase my skills and projects related to finance and investing requires-
<br>&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;      1. Planning, 
<br>&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;      2. Execution, and 
<br> &ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;&ensp;&thinsp;     3. Documentation. 

## Strategies: 

### 1. Algorithmic Trading Strategy:
Develop and backtest an algorithmic trading strategy using historical market data. Implement quantitative models, technical indicators, or machine learning algorithms to identify trading signals and automate the execution of trades.

### 2. [Portfolio Optimization:](PortfolioOptimization)
Construct an optimal portfolio by applying modern portfolio theory and asset allocation techniques. Utilize historical returns, risk measures, and correlations to determine the optimal allocation of assets that maximizes return and minimizes risk.

### 3. [Risk Modeling:](RiskModel)
Build a risk model to assess and manage the risk of a portfolio or investment. Explore techniques such as value-at-risk (VaR), stress testing, or Monte Carlo simulations to quantify and analyze the potential downside risk.

### 4. [Option Pricing Model:](OptionPricingModel)
Develop a quantitative model to price options using methods like Black-Scholes-Merton or binomial trees. Implement the model to calculate option prices and compare them with market prices to identify potential mispricings.

### 5. [Market Microstructure Analysis:](MarketMicrostructureAnalysis)
Investigate the dynamics of order flow, bid-ask spreads, or market liquidity using high-frequency trading data. Analyze market microstructure patterns and their impact on trading strategies or market efficiency.

### 6. [Event Study Analysis:](EventStudyAnalysis)
Conduct an event study to assess the impact of specific events (such as earnings releases, mergers, or economic announcements) on stock prices. Apply statistical techniques to measure abnormal returns and evaluate the significance of the event.

### 7. [Sentiment Analysis:](SentimentAnalysis)
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze news articles, social media data, or financial reports to gauge market sentiment. Assess the sentiment's impact on asset prices or build sentiment-based trading strategies.

### 8. [Machine Learning Applications:](MachineLearningApplication) 
Apply machine learning algorithms(linear regression, RF, Gradient boosting, SVM, RNN, LSTM, DNN, Reinforcement Learning) to solve finance-related problems, such as credit risk assessment, fraud detection, or investment recommendation systems. Use supervised or unsupervised learning techniques to make predictions or generate insights.
