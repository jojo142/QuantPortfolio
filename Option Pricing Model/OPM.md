## Developing a quantitative model to price options:
Implement the model to calculate option prices and compare them with market prices to identify potential mispricings.

### 1. Black-Scholes-Merton: 
It determine the fair value of an option by calculating the present value of the expected payoff at expiration. 
The model achieves this by assuming that investors are risk-neutral, meaning they are indifferent to risk and base their decisions solely on the expected return. This assumption allows the use of the risk-free interest rate as the discount factor. 
The model derives a partial differential equation, known as the Black-Scholes equation, that describes the relationship between the option price, the underlying asset price, time, and other parameters. The equation is solved to obtain a formula that provides the theoretical value of the option.The model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion and that the option can only be exercised at expiration. It takes into account various factors such as the current price of the underlying asset, the strike price, the risk-free interest rate, the time to expiration, and the volatility of the underlying asset.

### 2. Binomial Option Pricing Model (BOPM): 
It is a discrete-time model that assumes the underlying asset price can either go up or down over each time step. It calculates the option price by creating a binomial tree of possible future asset prices and evaluating the option's value at each node.

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation: 
It is a computational technique that uses random sampling to simulate the possible future paths of the underlying asset price. By simulating a large number of scenarios, the option price can be estimated by averaging the payoffs across the simulated paths.

### 4. Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Model (CRR):  
It is a variation of the binomial model that takes into account the risk-neutral valuation framework. It assumes that the probability of the underlying asset price going up or down is adjusted to match the risk-free interest rate. This model is an extension of the original binomial model and provides more accurate option pricing.

### 5. Heston Model: 
It is a stochastic volatility model that incorporates the dynamics of the underlying asset price and its volatility. It assumes that the volatility of the underlying asset follows a stochastic process and can change over time. The Heston model allows for more realistic modeling of option prices, especially for options on assets with volatile prices.

### 6. Lattice Model: 
Lattice models, such as the Trinomial Option Pricing Model (TOPM) or the Leisen-Reimer Model, extend the binomial model by introducing more possible outcomes for the underlying asset price movement at each time step. Lattice models provide finer granularity and accuracy compared to the original binomial model.

### 7. Finite Difference Methods: 
Finite difference methods approximate the continuous partial differential equations that describe option pricing. These methods discretize the space and time dimensions and solve for option prices numerically. They are widely used for complex options or when closed-form solutions are not available.
