### Predictive text: 
Utilized in predictive text features on smartphones, learning from user behavior and suggesting words or completing sentences based on the context and patterns of previous texts.

### Automatic summarization: 
Summarize large amounts of information quickly and accurately, understanding both the literal meaning and emotional context of the text, making the summarization process more efficient.

### Sentiment analysis: 
Helps computer systems understand the emotional sentiment behind texts, conversations, reviews, and comments, enabling a deeper understanding of content beyond literal meaning.

### Chatbots: 
Empowers chatbots to engage in interactive conversations, providing instant and accurate responses to customer queries, and understanding and responding to emotional sentiments effectively.

### Social media monitoring: 
Aids in analyzing unstructured social media data, allowing companies to gain insights about individuals, products, and services, which can be used to improve offerings and make informed decisions.

### Speech recognition:
