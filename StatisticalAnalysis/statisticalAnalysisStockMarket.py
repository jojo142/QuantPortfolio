# Step 1: Load and preprocess the data
data = pd.read_csv('stock_prices.csv')
# Perform any necessary data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering here

# Step 2: Descriptive Statistics
# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stats = data.describe()

# Step 3: Data Visualization
# Create line chart of stock price
plt.plot(data['Date'], data['Close'])
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Closing Price')
plt.title('Stock Price Movement')
plt.show()

# Step 4: Correlation Analysis
# Calculate correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = data.corr()

# Step 5: Hypothesis Testing
# Perform any hypothesis tests here

# Step 6: Time Series Analysis (ARIMA)
# Check stationarity of the time series
result = adfuller(data['Close'])
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('p-value:', result[1])

# Plot ACF and PACF
plot_acf(data['Close'])
plot_pacf(data['Close'])
plt.show()

# Fit ARIMA model
model = ARIMA(data['Close'], order=(1, 0, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Step 7: Regression Analysis
# Prepare the data for regression analysis
X = data[['Index1', 'Index2']]  # Independent variables
y = data['Close']  # Dependent variable

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Fit the linear regression model
reg_model = LinearRegression()
reg_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the stock prices
y_pred = reg_model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the mean squared error
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

# Step 8: Machine Learning Algorithms (LSTM)
# Prepare the data for LSTM
# Perform any necessary data preprocessing and scaling here

# Split the data into training and testing sets
train_size = int(len(data) * 0.8)
train_data, test_data = data.iloc[:train_size, :], data.iloc[train_size:, :]

# Prepare the training and testing data
# Perform any necessary feature engineering here

# Define the LSTM model
model = Sequential()
# Add LSTM layers and other necessary layers
# Compile the model

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Predict the stock prices
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 9: Model Evaluation and Validation
# Perform any necessary model evaluation and validation steps here

# Step 10: Interpretation and Reporting
# Communicate the findings and insights from the analysis

# Additional steps:
#now consider additional steps such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, ensembling, etc. based on specific requirements.
