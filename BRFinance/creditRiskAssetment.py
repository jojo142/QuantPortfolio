# Step 1: Data Collection
# Assuming you have a dataset in a CSV file
data = pd.read_csv('credit_data.csv')

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Assuming you have already preprocessed the data

# Step 3: Feature Selection/Engineering
# Assuming you have already selected the relevant features and transformed the data

# Step 4: Model Development
# Assuming 'X' contains the feature columns and 'y' contains the target variable
X = data.drop('default', axis=1)
y = data['default']

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Model Evaluation
# Predict the target variable for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Step 6: Model Deployment
# Assuming you have new loan application data to assess
new_loan_application = pd.DataFrame([{
    'age': 35,
    'income': 50000,
    'credit_score': 700,
    # Add other relevant features
}])

# Make predictions for the new loan application
new_loan_prediction = model.predict(new_loan_application)
print(f"New Loan Application Prediction: {new_loan_prediction}")

# Step 7: Ongoing Monitoring and Maintenance
# Continuously monitor and update the model as new data becomes available
